General Notes

I believe modules should be deep, not shallow. A little while ago, I did 
something very similar in our website for validating the Customer Information.
I exposed fromEditable and toEditable on the validatedPerson, to handle the 
transitions between editablePerson and validatedPerson.

EditablePerson needs to allow for improperly formatted data in order to represent the errors
in the validated person. I had this issue with birthdays, I was unable to display errors 
because the model wouldn't allow for them. 

I want to hide validation logic inside of the validatedPerson's fromEditable.
This means it's not possible to generate an invalid Person.

I'd also like the rest of the application only dealing with
the validatedPerson. It should be easy to add tests
around the validatedPerson's fromEditable. This modeling should be maintainable 
for future releases if/when validation logic changes or increases
